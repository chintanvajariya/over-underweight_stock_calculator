# Stock Weight Calculator

## Purpose

As my first foray into stock market analysis, I decided to make a project before diving into the machine learning. That way, I could delve into some integral skills such as Selenium, numpy, and matplotlib on their own. This Jupyter Notebook analyzes any inputted stock (Amazon and Apple in this case) and compares it with the S&P 500 to determine its "weight" compared to its peers. More details can be found in the .ipynb file included in this repository.

## Usage

As you'll learn by reading my Notebook, the weight of a stock helps investors decide if they should disproportionately include the security portfolio. For example, an investor might want to get rid of an underweight stock because it grows slower than its peers. As such, this tool allows for anybody to determine the weight of any stock.
